                              <p>Creativity is a form of problemsolving and fashion design is a problem.
                                 <br><br>
                                 We are breaking stereotypes, changing perspectives and the narrative. We offer consultancy, curation, content creation, styling, creative workshops, event, photo and video production, for institutions and the fashion industry. Our aim is to celebrate new narratives, networking, collaboration by taking African fashion to the next level. We want to educate and foreground the misrepresentation of fashion from Africa and its diaspora, as well as its inventiveness and creativity. We stand for participation, inclusion, representation and we support vocalising marginalised narratives with creative solutions.
                              </p>
                              <p>The different styles of clothing promote the indigenous techniques and traditional designs featured in African sub-cultures. The exhibition challenges the authenticity of stereotyping and gives a strong message about valuing diversity.
                                 <br>                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>We want to share Black stories and present outstanding photography of Black culture. With education as an essential focus of our work, there will be purposeful texts on different cultures.
                                 <br><br>
                                 Inspiration for the fashion designs comes from the history of the countries, as well as their politics. Influences from media, tourism and the importation of second-hand clothing from charity foundations also plays a role in developing fashion designs.
